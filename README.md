# Python-Flask-Word-Game-Web

This was a project that I worked on in my third year in college where we had to create a game where you are given a random word and have to make ten words out of it.

Various conditions will be checked for in Python i.e. The words entered have to be greater than two letters long can no be duplicates etc.

Once the game is complete, the user is shown how long it took them to come up with ten words. The user then enters their name, and if they are in the top ten quickest people then their name is displayed on the Highscore page.

This was our first project where we used the Flask framework with Python to create this game on a Website called "PythonAnywhere".
